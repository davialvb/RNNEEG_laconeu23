# Using simulated EEGs to train RNN and analyze real data
## The influence of potassium reversal potential on seizure

From synthetic data, we train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model the sequence of an electroencephalogram (EEG). We generated the training samples from the open-source simulation package of biological neural networks [NetPyNE](http://www.netpyne.org/index.html). Using NetPyNE, we modified some parameters at the cellular level of the brain. The K+ concentration in the extracellular space is one of the best described examples in seizures ion dinamics.

We generated simulations that were 23 seconds long with an internal integration timestep of 0.01. Data is sampled with a step size of 5 every millisecond totaling 260 simulations. Data were divided by 50% seizure and 50% non-seizure. Finally, we divide the simulation vector per second, totaling 5980 where we use 80% to train and 20% to test the model. This is a plotted example of the signals.

The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Epileptic+Seizure+Recognition) for model evaluation consists of 5 different folders, each with 100 files, with each file representing a single subject/person. Each file is a recording of brain activity for 23.6 seconds. The corresponding time-series is sampled into 4097 data points. Each data point is the value of the EEG recording at a different point in time. So we have total 500 individuals with each has 4097 data points for 23.5 seconds. This is a plotted example of the signals.
